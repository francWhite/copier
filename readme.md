# Copier

Allows you to specify folders/files to track and copies them to a target location. It continously watches changes on the specified files in the background and carry out copy operation. 


# Thoughts/Roadmap

1. Allow custom hooks. A hook lets developers to inject their own tasks to pre-copy, in-copy, and after-copy phases.
2. GUI for non-technical users by using WinForms for Windows users and other cross-platform UI libraries for Mac and Linux users. 

# Ideas

1. Allow optional arguments by accepting them with argument flags. For instance, base path can be skipped to use the current directory as the base path. -- Still thinking about this...
